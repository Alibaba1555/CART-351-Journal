<!-- Week 1 -->
<section class="entry">
  <div class="date">🗓 October 8, 2025</div>
  <div class="title">Reflections on Project 1: AIR QUEST</div>
  <div class="content">
This week, I finished building my first Python terminal app: AIR QUEST.  
The idea started from curiosity — I wanted to make air quality data feel more alive, not just numbers.

By using the [requests] library, I could connect directly to the World Air Quality API.  
[Rich] and [PyFiglet] added a playful and artistic layer — colors, ASCII banners, progress bars — all inside the terminal.  
It felt like designing a mini interactive world in text form.

The most exciting part was turning something environmental and scientific into something expressive.  
Watching the AQI bar grow, seeing emojis change with the air quality — it gave personality to data.  
Even though it runs entirely in the console, it feels emotional, like a digital creature breathing city air.

Below is a small web version of my AIR QUEST — you can enter any city to see real-time air quality:

  <!-- API -->
  <div class="aqi-box">
    <input type="text" id="city" placeholder="Enter city (e.g. Montreal)">
    <button onclick="fetchAQI()">Check Air</button>
    <div id="aqiResult">🌍 Waiting for input...</div>

<!-- Week 2 -->

  <div class="date">WEEK 2 October 20, 2025</div>
  <div class="title">Flask Exercise II — Turning Code into a Web Experience</div>
  <div class="content">
This week I completed **Exercise II: Working with Flask**, my first web app that runs entirely inside the browser.  
Compared with my previous terminal-based projects, this one felt more visual and interconnected — where logic, layout, and design come together.

I started by learning the basic structure of Flask:  
each **route** (like <code>/</code>, <code>/t1</code>, <code>/t2</code>, and <code>/thank_you_t2</code>) is linked to a view function,  
which renders an HTML template using <code>render_template()</code>.  
Inside the templates, I used **Jinja** for loops, if-statements, and <code>url_for()</code> to load dynamic content.  
For the **/t2** page, I created a **GET form** that collects user input, combines the text in Python, replaces all vowels with <code>*</code>, and returns the processed result to the page.

After finishing the main logic, I focused on the aesthetics.  
I redesigned the site to look like a small “donut shop” web page rather than a coding exercise,

<!-- Week 3 -->
<section class="entry">
  <div class="date">Week 3 — October 27, 2025</div>
  <div class="title">Reflection: FLASK III and FETCH</div>
  <div class="content">
    This week deepened my understanding of how client and server communicate through HTTP.  
    I learned that redirecting after a GET request isn’t just a formality—it prevents messy URLs and keeps data secure.  
    Working with Flask sessions showed me how to store temporary user data between requests,  
    while still understanding that it’s not meant for sensitive information.  
    The highlight of the week was using the <code>Fetch API</code> to send and receive data asynchronously,  
    letting the page update dynamically without reloading.  
    It felt like watching static code come alive.  
    Overall, Week 3 made me appreciate how structure, flow, and interactivity all come together in modern web apps.

<!-- Week 4 -->
<section class="entry">
  <div class="date">Week 4 — November 3, 2025</div>
  <div class="title">Reflection: Flask + Fetch Interaction</div>
  <div class="content">
    This week I worked on connecting Flask with client-side JavaScript using <code>fetch()</code>,
    and honestly, it was challenging.  
    Instead of relying on simple forms, I had to send JSON data manually, handle POST requests, and update the UI dynamically with the server’s response.  
    Debugging the data flow between the browser and Flask took time, especially when managing
    asynchronous logic and saving data into a text file.  
    Even though it felt difficult at moments, seeing my interactive drawing data send, save, and reappear on the page made it really satisfying.  
    I feel like I’m starting to understand how real interactive web tools are built.
