  <div class="title">Reflections on Project 1: AIR QUEST</div>
  <div class="content">
This week, I finished building my first Python terminal app: AIR QUEST.  
The idea started from curiosity — I wanted to make air quality data feel more alive, not just numbers.

By using the [requests] library, I could connect directly to the World Air Quality API.  
[Rich] and [PyFiglet] added a playful and artistic layer — colors, ASCII banners, progress bars — all inside the terminal.  
It felt like designing a mini interactive world in text form.

The most exciting part was turning something environmental and scientific into something expressive.  
Watching the AQI bar grow, seeing emojis change with the air quality — it gave personality to data.  
Even though it runs entirely in the console, it feels emotional, like a digital creature breathing city air.

Below is a small web version of my AIR QUEST — you can enter any city to see real-time air quality:

  <!-- API -->
  <div class="aqi-box">
    <input type="text" id="city" placeholder="Enter city (e.g. Montreal)">
    <button onclick="fetchAQI()">Check Air</button>
    <div id="aqiResult">🌍 Waiting for input...</div>

  <div class="title">Flask Exercise II — Turning Code into a Web Experience</div>
  <div class="content">
This week I completed **Exercise II: Working with Flask**, my first web app that runs entirely inside the browser.  
Compared with my previous terminal-based projects, this one felt more visual and interconnected — where logic, layout, and design come together.

I started by learning the basic structure of Flask:  
each **route** (like <code>/</code>, <code>/t1</code>, <code>/t2</code>, and <code>/thank_you_t2</code>) is linked to a view function,  
which renders an HTML template using <code>render_template()</code>.  
Inside the templates, I used **Jinja** for loops, if-statements, and <code>url_for()</code> to load dynamic content.  
For the **/t2** page, I created a **GET form** that collects user input, combines the text in Python, replaces all vowels with <code>*</code>, and returns the processed result to the page.

After finishing the main logic, I focused on the aesthetics.  
I redesigned the site to look like a small “donut shop” web page rather than a coding exercise,
